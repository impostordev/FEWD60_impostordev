PART 1: PSEUDO-CODE FUN
Write pseudo-code to figure out who the winner is in a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.  Using the ideas from out Thermostat code along create a rock paper scissors program.
ROCK PAPER SCISSORS:

1. Take in one of three choices from two players
2. Know which is value (r,p, or s) are greater than the other
3. Check the values given by the players
4. See if they one is greater or they match
5. Either tell which player one or if they match and should play again



get player_A_input
get player_B_input

    input r > input s
    input s > input p
    input p > input r

        check input values

            if player_A_input > player_B_input, 
              print "Player A Wins"
            if player_B_input > player_A_input, 
              print "Player B Wins"
            if player_A_input = player_B_input, 
              print "Play Again"
